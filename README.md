## 🎯 About the Project

**LaravelKnow** is a full-stack SaaS platform designed to solve one of the most frustrating parts of being a Laravel developer: losing hours searching for answers to problems that someone else has already solved.

Inspired by the best of **StackOverflow**, **GitHub Discussions**, **Notion**, and **Linear**, this platform gives you a structured, searchable, and community-driven knowledge base — 100% dedicated to the Laravel ecosystem.

> Built entirely with the Laravel stack. No Vue, no React, no Next.js. Pure Laravel, Livewire, Alpine.js, and Tailwind CSS.

### Key Architectural Decisions

**Polymorphic relationships** — `votes`, `comments`, `favorites`, `follows` all use morphs so a single table handles Problems, Solutions, and Comments without duplication.

**Denormalized counters** — `votes_count`, `solutions_count`, `comments_count` are stored directly on parent models and updated via Vote observers. No `COUNT()` on every page load.

**Smart duplicate detection** — `CreateProblem::updatedTitle()` fires a debounced Scout search on every keystroke and surfaces similar issues before submission, reducing duplicate content.

**URL-synced filters** — `ProblemList` uses Livewire's `$queryString` for all filters. Every filter is bookmarkable and the back button works natively.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **PHP** ≥ 8.3
- **Composer** ≥ 2.0

- **Meilisearch** — [install guide](https://www.meilisearch.com/docs/learn/getting_started/installation)

> 💡 This project was built with **Laravel Herd**. If you use Herd with the Livewire + Built-in Auth starter kit, Breeze is already installed — skip that step.
